\section{Conclusions}

This project surveyed utilizing four different machine learning algorithms, which are Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Random Forest, Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), and Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) for auto-tuning stencil computation on GPUs. The two regression tree algorithms performed decently well especially the Random Forest. KCCA was able to give better results by a margin, being away from best results from exhaustive search by less than 0.4\% in both benchmark applications. And it seems it need fewer number of training samples, although I haven't had time to confirm yet. Future work might be to find appropriate number of samples, and determine when to use KCCA, since it has much more complexity than other algorithms.
