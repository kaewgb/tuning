\section{Conclusion}

This paper has presented three direct interaction N-Body algorithms as well as proofs of their communication optimality. All algorithms provide the opportunity to minimize latency and bandwidth by utilizing extra memory. We also showed that they yield modest speedups on communication-bound problem instances. Our algorithms provide significantly better strong scaling, and consequently they can be scaled to larger machines without incurring substantial communication overhead.
